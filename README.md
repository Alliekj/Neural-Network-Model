## Neural Network Model for Alphabet Soup Charity Success Prediction


**Overview**
This project involves building and optimizing a deep learning model to predict the success of charity organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. The model uses a dataset containing various features of these organizations and aims to classify whether an organization will be successful based on these features.

**Data Preprocessing**
The dataset was preprocessed by removing non-beneficial ID columns and handling categorical data using one-hot encoding.
Rare occurrences in categorical data were grouped into "Other" categories to reduce noise.
The data was split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling was applied to ensure the model performs optimally.

**Model Design**
The model is a deep neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.
It consists of:
An input layer that matches the number of features in the dataset.
Two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions.
An output layer with a Sigmoid activation function to perform binary classification.

**Model Training and Evaluation**:
The model was compiled using binary crossentropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer.
It was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy and loss.
A callback was used to save the modelâ€™s weights every five epochs.

**Optimization**
Various techniques were used to optimize the model:
Adjusting the number of neurons and layers.
Experimenting with different activation functions.
Fine-tuning the number of epochs.
Modifying the input data by binning and scaling.
Despite these efforts, achieving the target accuracy of over 75% was challenging.

**Results**
The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72% after optimization.
Alternative models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting were suggested for potentially better performance.
